# Face Detection and Recognition 

My first project on Face Detection and Recognition Model using python , Machine Learning and Computer Vision library : üëâ OpenCV 

##  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è OPENCV

OpenCV is a Library which is used to carry out image processing using programming languages like python. This project utilizes OpenCV Library to make a Real-Time Face Detection using your webcam as a primary camera.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è COMPUTER VISION 

Computer vision involves seeing or sensing a visual stimulus, make sense of what it has seen and also extract complex information that could be used for other machine learning activities.

### FUNCTIONS 

#### CREATE DATASET :

‚è© I will try to detect the face of individuals using the ``` haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml ```
The dimensions of the image that we have used here was pretty large, so I have scaled down the image dimensions for better output.

#### TRAIN THE MODEL : 

‚è© This project uses LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) Algorithm to detect faces. It labels the pixels of an image by thresholding the neighborhood of each pixel and considers the result as a binary number.

#### RECOGNITION 

‚è© After training the model , I make the recognition of faces 


### HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT
